HasFlexibleFields
=================

The problem:

How does one add fields to a model (usually another project's models) without permanently altering the model structure?
What if the 'name' of the field was only known at runtime?

This plugin attempts to answer the above questions.

I rejected the idea of Entity-Attribute-Value
I had a look at has_magic_columns but the field labels/aliases need to be defined in code

Features:
Extends ActiveRecord
Uses a has_one association to a flexifields model
The flexifields model is polymorphic, one table to hold all has_one records for any model extentended by this plugin
Uses delegation to make some methods appear in the extended model.


NOTE: currently this version requires rails v 2.3.2

Example
=======

class Content < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_flexiblefields
end
where Content has title and body fields

Given a flexifield_def of say:
  flexdef1:
    id: 1
    name: Recipe

and flexifield_def_entries of:
  ffd1e1:
    flexifield_def_id: 1
    flexifield_name: ffs_01
    flexifield_alias: preparation time
    ordering: 1

  ffd1e2:
    flexifield_def_id: 1
    flexifield_name: ffs_02
    flexifield_alias: cooking time
    ordering: 2

Then this saves the additional content with the main content...
  r = Content.create! :title => 'Roast Pork Belly', :body => 'Ingredients: ...'
  r.assign_ff_def 1
  r.assign_ff_value 'preparation time', '25 minutes'
  r.assign_ff_value 'cooking time', '2 hours 30 minutes'
and
  r.ff_aliases # -> ["preparation time","cooking time"]
  r.ff_fields  # -> ["ffs_01","ffs_02"]
and
  r.to_ff_alias 'ffs_01'       # -> "preparation time"
  r.to_ff_field 'cooking time' # -> "ffs_02"

But forms that save to ffs_NN directly will also work.
